<p style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;text-align:left;">It was not about the outcome, but it was about the journey and experience”, Ricardo had explained while going through all of his past stories. When he was a young adult, he was not particularly the type of role model everyone sees him now as. Long ago before he was able to find work in my grandfather’s family shop, he had been scrambling day and night hoping to land a job in the narrow streets of Chinatown. He felt like as if life was strangling and pinning him down, the first encounter with fatherhood. Having no money to buy your family a decent dinner is a heartbreaking scene to imagine yourself in, he said, and stress is one of the biggest enemies I have faced in my whole life. As a matter of fact, the psychological pain burdens me at even greater levels for I can work and solve my financial problems in a week, but my mindset will take years of practice and acceptance. He was not the type to settle for just that, judging from the way he answered my questions, I thought. He was such a high spirited and competitive individual, but I guess deep down there lives a little man, seeking for a new life he can give his family. He often asks himself the question all of us struggle to answer: “Who exactly are we”? Since he had jumped from job to job, he said that he needed to shape himself in a way where he fits the hole that the employer was looking for. Often times he found it difficult in managing it and finds drinking as a cope up mechanism. Poverty in his own words was definitely not just something financial, but it is also about the well-being of one. At that point in time, he was financially struggling, but what’s more pressing is the psychological struggle. Quoting from him, “The mind is the source of all motivation, passion, love, and when it shuts down, everything will crumble apart in front of you”. Life then was a constant uphill battle I had to face alone, I always see to it that I make a little progress as each day passes by. 
<br><br>
Though, Ricardo’s past was not just filled with rough times. Based on his memories, the first time he stepped on my grandfather’s shop, he felt like he was welcomed with smiles. “It was like I found asylum in my life, where I could start living in peace and without uncertainty”. This was back in the 1980s, where my father was still a young teenager like me. Upon asking him, my father describes him as someone you can approach and make all the tiniest talks and it would still be interesting. There was even a time where Ricardo was busy with work but used his break for drawing my father a cute little Batman figure on his notebook. Yes, he said, that the minimum wage helped his family afford basic necessities, but it was the fact that he was able to give joy to everyone around him that made him sleep at ease. For around 30 years, he has been best friends with one of the longest workers too in our family shop, passed down to my father. They would walk together every night back to their homes, since it was relatively near to each other. I noticed the way he explained this part of the story, because I can see the genuine smiles every now and then including the small laughs about their funny moments at times. Then I asked him the question, “Do you think God gave you a best friend who has been through the same times as you”? He took quite some time to think about it and finally answered with a nod on his face. He explained that it takes two to tango, jokingly, but in a deeper sense I personally think he meant that facing mutual challenges with someone can relieve a lot of stress because you know that you are not alone. Additionally, he also mentioned that God was acting on him when he found his job, giving him a sign that says not to give up at any cost!
<br><br>
Looking back, he emphasizes on the fact that it is all about the mind. To be strong is not to  be buff physically, but it is so be buff mentally. Most failures are caused by giving up, and not because they are actually unable to. This is one of the driving forces that made Ricardo poor both financially and spiritually. Famous marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge, who almost broke the two hour mark for running a full length marathon, once said, “If I can offer one piece of advice, it would be to learn to control the mind and train each day with a positive attitude”. A lot of people in the slums now are mostly unmotivated to find work and would rather do crimes and drugs because of the higher pay they receive. That is one of the poverty traps present in the Philippines and it is difficult to get a grasp of because of how broad it is. Generalizing from what he said, I personally believe that the pressure is getting the best of these people. I mean, they are physically fit to work, but their mind says otherwise and thus affecting them in negative ways. Giving up seems like the easier way out of this mess they are in right now. 
<br><br>
Ricardo personally had a lot of insights from his past situations and highly links it with God taking action to the poor. He sounded grateful and blessed upon explaining what he felt after applying for his newfound job. “After experiencing what it feels like having a bright light guiding your path gives you a sudden change in emotion and a surge of motivation to continue on.” He is currently living happily with his wife while his son is working in another place, and still goes home with his best friend after work every day. Although he still feels that he can make slowly make more improvements as long as he keeps working day and night for both his family and himself. Motivation seems to be his top one word when it comes to sustaining your job, no matter the circumstance.
<br><br>
One of the biggest dreams he said that he had was to leave a legacy behind for everyone to look at. He strives to be a role model for all the people out there struggling to hang on with whatever problem they encountered. Also, he wants to leave a hefty amount of financial aid to his relatives so they can slowly climb out of the poverty trap. He mentioned that he would not want all of his grandchildren to face the same monsters he had to face when he was younger. He would sacrifice his own time just to keep his family in safety and peace. Again he mentioned something linked to psychological help when pertaining to solutions for poverty. “All the poor right now are poor because of the lack of motivation and perseverance, the government should shine a light to those who are willing to get out of their comfort zones”. With what he said, I believe that the government must give psychological aid and not just financial aid, because dependence to these aids will result to them falling deeper into the trap. To cap off the personal interview, he finally said that one will be able to find himself amidst the hardships. Ricardo definitely was able to know himself better and justify who he really is to everyone out there in the world. He strives to help other people overcome their own challenges in the future.
