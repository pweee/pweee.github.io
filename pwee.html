<p style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;text-align:left;">I grew up without a mother nor a father. <br>
<br>
  Family friends tell me that my father ended his own life trying to escape unpayable debt. My mother worked herself to death, only to leave me a pendant so faded I can’t tell what was written on it. Gossip from around the neighborhood hints that they even had to borrow money to pay the hospital for my birth. I grew up with my aunt, who passed away from old age when I was twelve. Due to these conditions, I was forced to live independently and forced to fend for myself for my entire life. I had to work while children my age were still studying, and while they were sleeping, I would force myself to study the books that I picked up from a local public school.
<br><br>
I’m Rosalinda, or you could call me Rose, and I’m 61 this year. Many people my age are retired, and to be honest, my knees often hurt from aging. Regardless, I am a proud cleaner. I have worked in the same building for the past 40 years, long enough for people here to recognize me when they see me.
<br><br>
I live in a small room in the basement of the building. It’s pretty cramped, and I share the room with another cleaner who takes the afternoon shift. I’ve always loved working the morning shift since it’s when I get to see everyone. The room I stay in is small, with barely enough space to stretch my arms fully. I get paid just a little above minimum wage, which is quite meager, but in the area I reside in, it’s quite a lot already, many are paid half of what I make. It’s not a lot, and considering I have to give some of it to my family who rely on me, it’s often not enough. On top of me, two children and three grandchildren are relying on my salary.
<br><br>
I don’t have a favorite food. To me, everything I get to eat is considered something special because I can only rarely afford to make a good dish because of my small budget I have for myself. I’ve only bought a single set of clothes a year for the past twenty years, because that is all that I afford. I often consider myself as economically poor, and poor in the sense that sometimes, I can’t afford some need.
<br><br>
Many people tell me to make a small business, or a sari-sari store, but even the “small” capital that’s needed, I don’t have. I guess I’m in what they call the poor, or those in poverty. I just deal with it, honestly; I budget what I have and just find a way to make the most of what I’m given. It is often enough when you live simply.
<br><br>
To be really honest, I think that I’m more than just my financial standing. I’d even consider myself lucky sometimes. The fact that I’m still alive today, and the fact that I’ve never had a major illness is a miracle in itself. The fact that my family is all well and good, my last grandchild about to graduate in a month is a blessing that I am forever thankful to the Lord for. My family has always been there for me, chatting with me when I seem sad, smiling all the time when I am there. They are all cheerful, happy and joyful. To me, my family is my greatest treasure and asset. Aside from them, I’m pretty loved by my community. When I would go home to my home in Navotas, I’d be greeted by uncles and aunties. I would often get tired from all the waving that I would have to do. Right after putting my things down in a tiny shack I call home, I’d grab bread at a small bakery, whose baker is my childhood friend. I would leave some of the bread at home, then go to my neighbors and chat with them. Chatting with them is so enjoyable that the day would end quite quickly. We’d talk about how our children are doing, how our lives are going, what’s going on in the community and so on. To many people, I seem to be wasting time, but I find this the simplest happiness that I can both afford and enjoy. In the area of having friends and relationships, I can proudly say that I’m rich. I am quite close with my community, even becoming a kagawad, or local leader in my area. Many people think that I’m kind and knowledgeable, that’s why they trust me.
<br><br>
If there was one thing that I can say about my situation, it’s that I think I’m blessed. I may not be rich, nor am I highly skilled in any major field. My job is only a measly cleaner, yet for some reason, I’ve gotten by for so long. I feel as if there is someone out there, probably God who is looking out for me. Whenever I go to Mass on Sunday, there seems to be this feeling of safety and security that I get. I enjoy hearing mass and listening to the priest explain readings. I’ve gone to Mass so much that you can wealthy in spirit. I know many reading by heart. If I can quote my favorite reading, it would be the one in the book Matthew, where Jesus told his disciples not to worry, for like the birds in the sky, and the flowers all so beautiful, we don’t need to worry, and toil our life away, for He will take care of us, the Lord’s people. That reading, is for me the most memorable one that I have heard because it seems to speak to me. I seem to be the one that the gospel is referring to. I’ve never really had to overwork myself, yet, some way, somehow, there’s always food on the table for me and my family, and when I don’t afford some things, the community seems to just cover up for me. For example, when my youngest grandchild caught pneumonia a few years ago, even before I knew the total bill, it was paid for already by some good Samaritan. Similar to how a Samaritan came for the injured man in the Bible when others ignored him, there is always this kind person who helps me when I am at hard times. The world isn’t so bad, especially the Philippine people. This may seem untrue to many, but, if there is a reason why I’ve never starved, it’s because there are people who care.
<br><br>
Many people say that the world is a harsh place. I think it’s just a matter of where you look. There is kindness and hope, but oftentimes, they are just covered by the interests of the greedy.
<br><br>
I don’t exactly have dreams, because I have pretty much everything i’ve needed and wanted. I simply want a humble, calm and peaceful life, and right now, I am living my dream. If there was something that I could hope for, possibly, it is that my children grow up to become responsible, honest and hardworking members of the community like me. I hope that the Lord blesses, guides and enlightens them in the same way he did for me.
<br><br>
In my opinion, poverty is just a way of seeing people based sheerly on their financial standing. In my personal experience, I’ve never seen someone truly hardworking not able to live simply. Possibly, in some areas people have worse conditions, and to them I say, “diskarte”; find a way, for there are many job opportunities in the Philippines. One way or another, you can, and you will find that job that you are ever so hopeful. The Lord will find a way for you. To those who think that the money that they are making is not enough, I’d suggest that you try to live a simpler life. In many cases, I think simpler is actually better. Having less means less to worry about, and over time, I’ve realized that what’s truly priceless are friendships and relationships. They can fill in the gap for pretty much anything you lack. For everything else, leave it to God, for he will care for you and make sure that you are alright.
<br><br>
I’m blessed, and most likely, you are too. If you aren’t, I would suggest that you try in trusting the Lord. He will take care of you, like the flowers and the birds in the sky. We are more than what’s in our wallets. We are people, not banks. Money doesn’t shape who we are as much as our relationships, friendships and faith. We just need to trust in Him.
