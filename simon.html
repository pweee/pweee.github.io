    In Pasinaya, I was able to meet Joy Garlitos, a mom of three who worked at home as a housewife. Her husband came home every other day as he worked in Manila as a construction worker, and so she has to work hard for her children everyday. Although she can be considered as “poor”, she has the willpower and determination to makes ends meet. Rather than simply waiting for her husband to come back with his salary, she chooses to work hard on her farm alongside keeping her kids happy. She is also active in her community and is well known in her street as she is always kind and loving towards other families. When I asked her what she was most grateful for, she mentioned how she loved her family. She then expounded on how everyone on her street was also her family and she was thankful that all of them were able to have great relationships with each other and this relationship with everyone makes her time there so much better. While staying with her, she always remained humble, constantly apologising for the “dirty house” or the “poor food”, when in actuality I was shocked to see the extent of her hospitality and her instant love for someone she just met. While I would not really call her religious, I saw that she was touched by God due to her being a person filled with love. 
<br><br>
    Before going in depth into what I really saw in nanay Joy, I want to share my preconceptions on going to Pasinaya. At first, I was scared. I heard of many stories of people getting robbed and possibly kidnapped. While this did not hinder me from going, I was very reluctant to make new relationships there. Furthermore, I did not fully see the point of going to a poor community for three whole days. On my way there, I was plagued by doubt and was scared to see how far away it was from the city I knew and called home. Upon arriving, my doubts were still prevalent, but slightly dispelled by the immediate hospitality of the people there. One hour after arriving, I was surprised breath-taken due to the raw love I had experienced in the short amount of time I was there. I realised that maybe I would find a home in Pasinaya, and a new family in the Garlitos household. This was all thanks to Nanay Joy. 
<br><br>
    While it is cliché, I could really see God’s presence in her life through her kids and neighbours. Although she might be considered poor, she certainly was not poor in love as she received so much from those around her. The community in itself was God’s blessing and love towards her. A specific time that I saw this was when all the kids came out to play, and her and the other moms gathered together to talk for hours and laugh alongside the kids. The raw joy I experienced from this group was simply amazing. Not only did she receive this love though, but she also gave this same love back, towards the community. One of the nights I stayed there, she stayed outside and barbecued chicken and pork for the whole street and us kids. I myself experienced this love in many forms such as her teaching me how to play PusoyDos, cooking for me, buying bread just because I liked it, and many many more. By using the aspect of faith as a way of knowing concerning looking at love as evidence, I was able to gain the knowledge that she was the complete opposite of poor as she was blessed by so much love.
<br><br>
    In the end of our stay there, I realised that being financially poor did not mean that your heart had to be filled with malice and envy. It also did not mean that god was not present in your life. Nanay Joy was the living example of this as her heart was filled with joy and a deep understanding of unconditional love. I was also able to see how God can truly be with us through those around us; through those who make us laugh and are there with us simply to be with us. I was able to conclude in the end that, being financially unstable does not mean that you are poor in spirit as well, and this was all thanks to Nanay Joy and her help through sharing her life with me.
