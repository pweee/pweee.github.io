    This is Kuya Dondon. He is currently working for my family’s business in the province as a driver but he also helps out in many errands in the city. I’ve somewhat known him for a few months as he started doing more of his work here in Manila  every Saturday so my father allows him to have his lunch with our maids during this time. It is a very stressful job considering he also leaves quite late during Saturday considering that he arrives even before some of my family and I wake up. I wanted to know what drives him and find out more about someone I see routinely so when he was free during Saturday, I asked him if he wanted to talk and I discovered that he is more than just an employee. It is no surprise that many of our drivers, maids, janitors and security guards are not very well off because of their lack of opportunity to find a better paying job albeit, the lack of a formal education or a poor family background in general and Kuya Dondon said himself that he isn't any different. His family originally lived in the province where he currently works at for my family’s business but moved to the city find a better life. He said that while he did finish high school, his family couldn’t afford his tuition for college. He learned how to drive by performing jobs to support his family around the city and just about 8 years ago, he started being a driver from a similarly well of family like mine but had to leave when that family migrated abroad and after months of looking for a new but similar job, he ended up working for my family.

   One of the questions I asked him was if he was satisfied with his job and if he was happy. He smiled and said that he is grateful that he has a steady job with a generous employer and that what his job is doesn’t really matter unless he is treated fairly and that it is enough to sustain him and his family. He said that life does have it’s problems and not everyone is lucky enough to avoid these but dwelling on them shouldn’t be a big issue. I then asked him as well if he wanted to share these problems he faces and if he has any thoughts on these. It was the best way I ask about  more about his situation without being too intrusive or rude and he did appreciate this, telling me that he was grateful for my willingness to listen and understand him even for just a short time and that I will use it for a project of mine. He tells me that his problems aren’t too different from many other families in the Philippines and some may be experiencing worse circumstances than he is. He admits that his work does leave him little time to rest beyond Sundays and it can feel like a thankless job at many times. He also mentions that his family is quite big, with him having 8 other siblings, all with their own lives under one roof and him being the second eldest among them. It is no surprise that money is always problematic and they need to make sacrifices in order to support each other. Some of them works as hard as he does but some work but only to really support their own family that they had quite early. Their family is very much grateful to eat 3 full meals a day and have running water and electricity although they have experienced several occasions such as during major typhoons and during the inflation crisis that feeding themselves and the children had to be prioritised. He does mention however, that some of their siblings have started to focus more on their work as one of them who already had a family was going through a difficult moment. His son was diagnosed with a mental disorder (Kuya Dondon was not exactly sure what it was other than it impaired speech and brain development) and treatment costs were piling up for him. Nevertheless, he still considers them all family and said that they come first before his own ambitions and desires in life. He said that he doesn’t want to consider himself and his family poor because it simply feels like a hindrance and that working had is the only way to succeed in life. It was at this point I did ask the big question of if and how he sees God in His life with all these issues . To my surprise, he said that faith and truly believing in God for him can be a double edged sword. While his parents are religious, he and many of his siblings truly believe that life has to be practical and God cannot solve your problems through faith alone but if we can use this faith to motivate yourself. He told me that there needs to be a balance between having faith in God and relying on and making the most of what you have.

   When I was conducting this interview, it honestly felt awkward at times as asking about the life of someone that you don’t really know personally and seemingly cannot relate with even if I do see him every Saturday. Really getting to know his views, understanding his motivations and thoughts of his life and even just simply sitting down and interacting can already break this seeming divide and provide solidarity in his poverty. After hearing his story, poverty seems to hold on it’s core definitions and interpretations, wherein people cannot provide enough for themselves and their families to consistently live a normal life and the societal injustices that hinder their opportunities , but can extend to a poverty that involves their own beliefs, a poverty caused by not being able to look after himself for a greater good he believes in and a poverty of circumstance that he chose to endure. Even in all these stressful endeavours in life and his need for justice, Kuya Dondon still sees the good and appreciates what he can work with. While he believes God isn't the full answer to his problems, His presence is still acknowledged with gratefulness of the people and moments that make life a bit more manageable. I lastly asked him what where his dreams, what is his future hopes are and it simply to make his family happy and together with his siblings, provide their family a new and better home later on. Kuya Dondon is not the typical example of someone who experiences poverty. While he can provide food and basic things for himself and help out his family with this, he does not lack in faith and appreciates God’s presence as something that keeps Him inspired to carry on. What he shows is that poverty can happen to anyone, there will always be unfair circumstances and injustices in the world and all we can do is face it. In facing it, unity and understanding of those in poverty is the only way how to break the structure and societal issue that causes it. After all, to walk with the other, is to walk with Jesus and it’s just like going home.
